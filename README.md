# Android app to organise sports events
## 2nd year software engineering project

This is an app designed to make it quick and easy to organise sports games/events. To create an event, the captain of one team selects their opponent, the location and the time. All players on both teams are then notified in their app. Players can be part of multiple teams and squad selection by captains allows easy organisation of who is playing on game day.
